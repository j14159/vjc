# Out of the Tarpit

Ben Moseley, Peter Marks, 2006. [PDF](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf), 66 pages.

## Abstract

Complexity is the single major difficulty in the successful development of large-scale software systems. Following Brooks we distinguish
accidental from essential difficulty, but disagree with his premise that most complexity remaining in contemporary systems is essential. We
identify common causes of complexity and discuss general approaches which can be taken to eliminate them where they are accidental in
nature. To make things more concrete we then give an outline for a potential complexity-minimizing approach based on functional pro-
gramming and Coddâ€™s relational model of data.

There is a Google group set up by Ben Moseley, but it's been mostly tumbleweeds for a few years.
