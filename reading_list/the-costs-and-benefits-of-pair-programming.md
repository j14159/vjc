## Abstract

Pair or collaborative programming is where two
programmers develop software side by side at
one computer. Using interviews and controlled
experiments, the authors investigated the costs
and benefits of pair programming. They found
that for a development-time cost of about 15%,
pair programming improves design quality,
reduces defects, reduces staffing risk, enhances
technical skills, improves team communications
and is considered more enjoyable at statistically
significant levels.
