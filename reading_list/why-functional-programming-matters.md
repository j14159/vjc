# Why Functional Programming Matters

## Abstract

As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more
important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write,
easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be re-used
to reduce future programming costs. Conventional languages place con-
ceptual limits on the way problems can be modularised. Functional lan-
guages push those limits back. In this paper we show that two features of
functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy eval-
uation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we manipu-
late lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement
the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in
game-playing programs). Since modularity is the key to successful pro-
gramming, functional languages are vitally important to the real world.
